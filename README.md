# Exploring X-Ray Scans

## Description

This Jupyter notebook explores the various computer vision techniques that can be used to extract features from an image. Techniques such as PCA and DAISY are performed on an X-Ray Scan dataset meant to diagnose pneumonia. As such, this notebook is a precursor to the pneumonia diagnosis algorithm that I have in a different repo. Although there is no prediction task in this notebook, the visualization techniques are meant to provide insight into the dataset, thereby enhancing the preprocessing and modeling in development.
